Description:

Creation of water proof devices for protections in mutability


Goals:

Tamper proofs commits.
Water proofs firmwares and devices
Forensics beyond force points CEX DEX kernels.


Materials in Cost benefits:
Physics: depends of the force and entropy.
Chemicals: depends of chemical
Resisn: Middle point in axial forms in different layers. (nature papers)
Nanomaterials: expensive
